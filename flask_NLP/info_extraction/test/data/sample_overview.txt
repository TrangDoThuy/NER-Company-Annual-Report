Agilent Technologies, Inc. ("we", "Agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is the world's premier measurement company providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries.    For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008, we have two business segments comprised of the electronic measurement business and the bio-analytical measurement business. Our electronic measurement business focuses on the communications and electronics industries, while our bio-analytical measurement business focuses on the life sciences industry and in the environmental, chemical, food and petrochemical industries and in materials sciences. In addition to our two businesses, we conduct centralized research through Agilent Technologies Laboratories ("Agilent Labs"). Each of our businesses, including Agilent Labs, is supported by our global infrastructure organization, which provides shared services in the areas of finance, information technology, legal, workplace services and human resources.    We sell our products primarily through direct sales, but we also utilize distributors, resellers, manufacturer's representatives, telesales and electronic commerce. Of our total net revenue of $5.77 billion for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008, we generated 32 percent in the U.S. and 68 percent outside the U.S. As of October 31, 2008, we employed approximately 19,600 people worldwide. Our primary research and development and manufacturing sites are in California, Colorado, Delaware and Washington in the U.S. and in China, Germany, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Kingdom.    Beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2009, we will report our results in three separate business segments comprised of the electronic measurement business, the bio-analytical measurement business and the semiconductor and board test business. The new semiconductor and board test segment will combine laser interferometer, parametric test and printed circuit board manufacturing test equipment. At the same time, we will move microscopy measurement from the bio-analytical  3 measurement segment to the electronic measurement segment. More details on these changes are included beginning on page 52 under the heading of 2009 Segment Reporting Change within the Management Discussion and Analysis. The business description in this Item 1 reflects the two segment structure as of and for the year ended October 31, 2008.    The net revenue, income from operations and assets by business segment as they were structured as of and for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008 for each of the past three years are shown in Note 21, "Segment Information", to our consolidated financial statements, which we incorporate by reference here.
