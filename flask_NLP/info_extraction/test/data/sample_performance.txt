Agilent Technologies, Inc. ("we", "Agilent" or the "company") is the world's premier measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. As of October 31, 2008, Agilent has two primary businesses focused on the electronic measurement market and the bio-analytical measurement market. Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.    In December 2005, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business. In 2006, we completed the initial public offering of our semiconductor test solutions business, Verigy Ltd. ("Verigy"). The results of our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.    Agilent's net revenue from continuing operations in 2008 was $5,774 million, an increase of 7 percent in comparison to 2007. Foreign currency movements accounted for 3 percentage points of revenue growth compared to 2007. A further one percentage point of revenue growth in 2008 was attributable to acquisitions. Our bio-analytical measurement business performed well throughout the year and net revenue in 2008 increased by 14 percent in comparison to 2007. Foreign currency movements and acquisitions accounted for 5 and 2 percentage points, respectively, of bio-analytical measurement business revenue growth compared to 2007. Demand for our bio-analytical measurement products and services increased across all markets in which our life science and chemical analysis businesses operate. In our electronic measurement business, net revenue in 2008 increased 2 percent in comparison to 2007. Adjusted for foreign currency movements, electronic measurement revenue declined one percent in 2008 compared to 2007. Our electronic measurement business saw reasonable growth in the communications test market, but a slight decline in the general purpose test market compared to 2007. Growth for the electronic measurement segment was led by broadband and wireless manufacturing test markets and wireless R&amp;D. The decline in general purpose test was attributable to weakness in computer and semiconductor market. Agilent's total net revenue in 2007 increased 9 percent in comparison to 2006.  36   Net income was $693 million in 2008 and $638 million in 2007. Net income in 2006 was $3,307 million, which included the income from and gain on sale of our semiconductor products business for $1,816 million, the income from the discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business for $54 million and a gain of $901 million on the sale of our investment in Lumileds.    In 2008, 2007 and 2006 we generated operating cash flows from continuing operations of $ 756 million, $969 million and $431 million, respectively. As of October 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 we had cash and cash equivalents balances $1,405 million, $1,826 million and $2,262 million, respectively.    The recent capital and credit market crisis is adversely affecting the U.S. and global economies. This can have adverse effects on Agilent's markets. Slower economic growth could lead to lower demand for Agilent's products and services. Looking forward, we face challenging business conditions as the global economic environment deteriorates and the outlook is uncertain. Our primary strategy is to pursue profitable markets with our leading-edge measurement solutions. Our operating model enables us to allocate resources to opportunities and to increase the variability of our cost structure.
